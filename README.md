## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various basic operations in NumPy, such as creating arrays, accessing and modifying elements, performing mathematical operations, and using aggregation functions. It serves as a great introduction to anyone new to data manipulation with NumPy.

## Getting Started
To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system, along with the NumPy library.

## Features
- **Array Creation**: Creating arrays from lists, zeros, ones, and random values.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing elements, rows, and columns.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and more.
- **Aggregating Functions**: Summing, finding the mean, max, min, etc.
- **Manipulating Arrays**: Adding, removing, and replacing elements.
- **Reshaping Arrays**: Reshaping, stacking, and splitting arrays.

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the code files. Each script demonstrates specific NumPy operations, so you can run them in your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numpy-basics.git
cd numpy-basics
```

Make sure to have Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to run the code.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed. 
2. Install NumPy if it's not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```
